# Feedy

Feedy is a Google Chrome extension. Users can click on the icon next to the omnibox and a bubble will open where they can enter the URLs of RSS, Atom, or Media RSS feeds to monitor. They can also stop monitoring feeds they've added earlier. When a monitored feed has a new post, you get an Desktop Notification.
Also feed news listing is supported in the popup.
